2496. Maximum Value of a String in an Array (Easy)
The **value** of an alphanumeric string can be defined as:

- The **numeric** representation of the string in base `10`, if it comprises of digits **only**.
- The **length** of the string, otherwise.

Given an array `strs` of alphanumeric strings, return the **maximum value** of any string in
`strs`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["alic3","bob","3","4","00000"]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- "alic3" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- "bob" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- "3" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.
- "4" also consists only of digits, so its value is 4.
- "00000" consists only of digits, so its value is 0.
Hence, the maximum value is 5, of "alic3".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["1","01","001","0001"]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Each string in the array has value 1. Hence, we return 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 100`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 9`
- `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters and digits.
